## Description

This project introduces a dynamic spatial-temporal modeling approach to forecast carbon emissions. The model leverages spatial correlations and temporal dynamics to provide more accurate predictions. The repository includes the source code and datasets.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code provided in this repository:

- Python: `3.8.18`
- Hydra: `2.5`
- Hydra Core: `1.3.2`
- PyTorch: `2.0.1` or above
- NumPy: `1.24.4`

These are the core requirements; however, additional packages may be needed as you work through the project. Please install any other necessary packages as required.

## Model Training

To train the model, you will need to run the script located at `src/model/DSTGCRN/run.py`. By default, the script is configured to train on a dataset from China. The relative path `src/model/DSTGCRN/run.py` is based on the scenario where `DSTGCRN` is the folder you navigate to as the starting point.

You can also specify different datasets by using the `dataset` argument when running the script.

```bash
python src/model/DSTGCRN/run.py dataset=US
python src/model/DSTGCRN/run.py dataset=EU
```
